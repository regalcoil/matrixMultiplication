# matrixMultiplication
Python, Linear Algebra, Matrix Multiplication

Open your preferred command line terminal. Before running proceeding, make sure your Python version is at least 3.0.0.

After cloning the git repository, change the directory in your terminal to the new folder matrixMultiplication.

Enter the command `python3 matrixMult.py` to open the matrix multiplication calculator.

Following the logic AB = C, the calculator will ask you to enter the number of rows in A (m), the number of columns in A which must be equal to the number of rows in B (n), as well as the number of columns in B (p). Once these parameters are specified, the calculator will walk you through the formation of each matrix.

As the last index of the matrix is entered, the matrices will be explicitly printed in the console. For the time being, these matrices are reported in 2-dimensional list/array form. The answer, C, will display at the bottom in a separate line in the same format.

If you are interested in multiplying another set of matrices, the calculator will ask you to enter `yes`. Press ENTER when you are done.
